Overview
--------

The Book Outline Block module provides one block that dynamically loads the
Table of Contents of the Book of the current menu item. If the page you are on
is not part of a book, the block will not display.

Background
----------

The core book module provides one book navigation block, but that block
displays all of the books on the site. Some users have navigation to
individual books in the primary links or elsewhere but still want a block to
navigate within the current book. That's what this module provides.

Installation
------------

See http://drupal.org/node/70151 for information on installing modules.

Configuration
-------------

The block configuration page 
(admin/structure/block/manage/bookoblock/book_outline/configure)
allows you to set the desired depth of the Book Outline Block. Once you have
set your desired Outline Depth (or left the default), you can assign the block
to any region as you would any other block.
